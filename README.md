## Implementation Details

The currency conversion process works as follows:

1. The API receives a request with source currency, target currency, and amount
2. It validates that both currencies are supported
3. If both currencies are the same, it returns the original amount
4. Otherwise, it fetches all available cryptocurrency markets from Buda.com
5. For each cryptocurrency available:
   - It checks if markets exist for both source and target currency
   - It calculates the conversion rate through this cryptocurrency
   - It keeps track of the best conversion rate found
6. The API returns the converted amount and the cryptocurrency used as intermediary
